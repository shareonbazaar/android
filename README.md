# Bazaar #

**Bazaar is a place for empowerment**. We believe locals and newcomers should share their skills and learn from each other.

## What is this repository for?

This repository is to keep track of the development of the mobile version of the application ([Bazaar](https://www.shareonbazaar.eu/)) in android. Feel free to contribute as long as you follow the **Contribution guidelines**.

## How do I get set up?

## Contribution guidelines

* Design mockups for User Interfaces first (if working on a new UI or making adjustments)
* Write method/function signature
* Write tests for each method/function signature (test first programming paradigm)
* Then write method/function body to pass the test
* Each method must solve one and only one task
* Others would come as we progress on development
